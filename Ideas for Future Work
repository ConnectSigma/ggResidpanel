Future Work
---------------

Katie's Tasks:
- try to figure out why plotly graphs showing up horizontally (still an issue?)
- Work on residual vignette (IN PROGRESS)
  - include a link to the residual document in the documentation
- modify so works for predictive models (Research at least)(NOT FOR CRAN)
  -randomForest (from randomForest): contains 'y' and 'predicted' (class is randomForest.formula)(
  - neuralnet (from neuralnet): contains 'response', 'covariates' and 'data' (class is nn)
  - nnet (from nnet): contains 'residuals' and 'fitted.values' (class is nnet)
  - svm (from e1071): contains 'fitted' and 'residuals' (class is svm)
- test file using testthat
  - how to add lmertest to testthat, but still test lmer as well ???
  - Added in section for warnings and errors, tested all formatting options with 2 plots
  - NOTE:USING THE WORD plot instead of plots
  - NOTE: if plotting a panel of four plots, nrow DOES NOT USE THIRD ROW when nrow = 3
- proof read tutorial and ggresidpanel vignette
- check for density curve fit to histogram reference
- shorten title of constant leverage plot
- round all values shown in interactive plots

- Completed:
  - Rounded data tooltip to 2 decimal places if a decimal is present in any of the numbers and the variable is numeric
      - Potential problem: data like 0.00032, 0.0056, etc.
  - add code used to create sticker under data raw (code currently not working)

  - fix resid_interact for binomial case to be more general (Double check names with Katherine)
  - make smoother tooltips consistent (Do we want observation added for smoother?)

Katherine's Tasks
- current:

- later:
  - cleaning board game data and coach salary data to use for paper
    (and vignettes?)
  - add in links in vignettes to the residual vignette (when finished)
  - contact Jessica Meir to ask for citation of penguin data
  - figure out how to use the "safely" and "quietly" functions to only show
    desired warnings and suppress the error:
    grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
      polygon edge not found


Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer (Katie)
- look into testthat and vistest packages for testing
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- add in minimum package versions?? (under imports)
- add interactive versions of the auxpanel, xpanel, and compare plots
  - maybe add an option in each of the functions for an interactive version
- option to color residuals by predictor variables?
- add a resid versus y plot
