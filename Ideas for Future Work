Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- update histogram tooltip
  -shows count as count and density as count: try to change name of density to density
- try to figure out why plotly graphs showing up horizontaly
- Work on residual vignette
- constant leverage factor plot
  - Perform more error checking with more than categorical variable
  - add to test file and add lmertest to test functionality on lmer objects
- modify so works for predictive models (Research at least)
  -receive predictive model in resid_panel
- remove obs from data for interactive plots for the index plot
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
  - not a function in ggresidpanel yet

Katherine's Tasks:
- finish the column and row selection
- figure out the axis labels with the interactive panel
- update documentation (I've noticed some typos and need to update for changes)
- add interactive plot to readme (see plotly readme)
- create a development rmd file with updates for each version
- add alpha values to lev plot
  -figure out what alpha is
  -add example of interpreting
- create a panel of residual plots verses the X's and y versus X's
  - include example with time predictor

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- create a panel of residual plots verses the X's and y versus X's
  - include example with time predictor
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- remove periods after non-sentences in documentation
- Improve the R plots — don’t just copy what the default in R gives — make it better
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each residual type
  - maybe look for great lakes data
- look into testthat and vistest packages for testing (then could put the testthat folder in
  gitignore)
- Include a link to the residual document in the documentation
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer (Katie)
- Suggested not changing the version to 1.0.0 until the package is ready for CRAN (or wide usage)
- Could look into more helpful diagnostic plots that exist
- Add in minimum package versions?? (under imports)

Presentations:
- ISU graphics group fall 2018 (request to present)
- LunchinatoRs fall 2018 (request to present)
- Agricultural Meeting in Baltimore (look into)

Mystery Errors/Warnings:

geom_path: Each group consists of only one observation. Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic?
Warning messages:
