Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- update resid_interact to show relevant info
- look into when to use the constant leverage factor plot
- suppress geom_path warning
- change titles to shorter names
- include a binomial example in resid_panel
- update histogram tooltip
- change upper limit of variables in tooltip

Katherine's Tasks:
- email Heike about plotly error and other error
  - Error in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
  polygon edge not found
- add alpha values to lev plot

Other To Do Before Conference:
- get new version up and running
- update README.md
- create a development rmd file with updates for each version
- design and print stickers
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each residual type

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- Include a link to the residual document in the documentation
- figure out how to get desired order of plots when individual plots are requested
- include a SASextended option
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer
- put interactive plots in a grid
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- modify so works for predictive models

Mystery Errors/Warnings:

geom_path: Each group consists of only one observation. Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic?
Warning messages:
1: In sqrt(0.5 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
2: In sqrt(0.5 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
3: In sqrt(1 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
4: In sqrt(1 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced

Error in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
