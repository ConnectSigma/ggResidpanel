Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- histogram fix so no outliers cutoff
- add label function to all plots
- change all functions to accept different residual types
- change qq plot to the version created by Adam and Heike with an option to have a confidence band (qqplotr)
- create resid_interact
  - make the individual interactive plots first
  - can show response, all predictors, row number, only first five predictors
- move error messages to resid_panel function - use class to specify four model types

Katherine's Tasks:
- add additional two plots to SASextend
- figure out error with text table that sometimes appears:
  Error in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
  polygon edge not found
- Completed:
  - add smoother to residual plot for R panel
  - residual vs. leverage plot - clean up code
  - create response versus predicted
  - summary statistc/model fit values panel
  - fix problem with SASextend
  - add options for theme
  - add options for text size

Other To Do Before Conference:
- move all documentation to resid_panel or supplemental document
- improve examples in help file for resid_panel
- figure out how to get standardized lmer and glmer residuals
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each of residual type
- get new version up and running
- design and print stickers

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- put interactive plots in a grid
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- write a function for showing plots from multiple transformations (the user can specify
  the transformations)
