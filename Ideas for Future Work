Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- check on qqplot
- scale-location plot

Katherine's Tasks:
- residual vs. leverage plot

1. Make R panel
2. Make additional plot options
3. Option for choosing types of residuals
4. Make plots interactive

Ideas for future updates:
- adjust the function to be able to take in either a model or residuals and fitted values (or
  let them specify a specific type of residuals...?)
- be able to choose SAS versus R default residual panel
- be able to choose specific plots to show in the panel
- plots to add:
    - standardized residual plot
    - add a smoother to the residual plot
    - leverage plot (version from R)
    - Cook's D plot from SAS
    - influence plots
    - response versus predicted (with a fitted line)
    - ??? summary statistc/model fit values panel
    - make our own version of influential points plot
- edit examples to make for R correct
- add options for theme, text size, axis labels, etc...
- go through and make sure all functions have the same formatting
- incorporate plotly, so you can identify outliers more easily (could include this as an option,
  so the user can decide whether they want their plots to be interactive or not)
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- write a function for showing plots from multiple transformations (the user can specify the
  transformations)
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
