Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- suppress geom_path warnin
  - possible to do with labeling for the interactive plots
- update histogram tooltip
  -Check interactive histogram box and what shows
- Could possibly use the function “suppress_messages” to not have the plotly error showing
  - suppress messaage about using github version of plotly
  - try suppressPacakgeStartupMessage()
- try to figure out why plotly graphs showing up horizontaly
- remove interactivity for density curve in resid_hist
- try to add data to interactive qq plot
- Work on residual vignette
- constant leverage factor plot
  - create separate r function called by the helper
- modify so works for predictive models (Research at least)


Katherine's Tasks:
- updates for lmertest object
- maybe add some sort of random forest or other method to examples in resid_auxpanel
- create a development rmd file with updates for each version
- add alpha values to lev plot
  -figure out what alpha is
  -add example of interpreting
- figure out how to get desired order of plots when individual plots are requested
- add interactive plot to readme (see plotly readme)
- look into broom package
- Include a resid vs. index plot (he likes to look at this plot often)

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- create a panel of residual plots verses the X's
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- remove periods after non-sentences in documentation
- Improve the R plots — don’t just copy what the default in R gives — make it better
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each residual type
  - maybe look for great lakes data
- look into testthat and vistest packages for testing (then could put the testthat folder in
  gitignore)
- Include a link to the residual document in the documentation
- maybe instead pick our own default, and not worry about SASextended (but leave SAS as option)
    -Possible plots: residual plot, qq plot, cook's d or histogram instead, resid vs. index
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer (Katie)
- put interactive plots in a grid
- Suggested not changing the version to 1.0.0 until the package is ready for CRAN (or wide usage)
- Could look into more helpful diagnostic plots that exist
- Add in minimum package versions?? (under imports)

Presentations:
- ISU graphics group fall 2018 (request to present)
- LunchinatoRs fall 2018 (request to present)
- Agricultural Meeting in Baltimore (look into)

Mystery Errors/Warnings:

geom_path: Each group consists of only one observation. Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic?
Warning messages:
1: In sqrt(0.5 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
2: In sqrt(0.5 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
3: In sqrt(1 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
4: In sqrt(1 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced

Error in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
