Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- DATA!!!!!
- try to figure out why plotly graphs showing up horizontally
- Work on residual vignette (IN PROGRESS)
  - include a link to the residual document in the documentation
- plot_ls
  - trying to suppress "pseudoinverse" warning
- plot_lev
  - note that plot will not be created if there are categories with only one observation due to hat values of 1
  - Question: when would contour lines not appear?
- constant leverage factor plot
  - use isConst.hat from getanywhere(plot.lm) (DONE)
  - Perform more error checking with more than categorical variable
  - add to test file and add lmertest to test functionality on lmer objects
- modify so works for predictive models (Research at least)(NOT FOR CRAN)
  -receive predictive model in resid_panel
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time (In Progress)
  - resid_compare
- fix resid_interact for binomial case to be more general
- add lme examples to tests
- switch the order of the plots in resid_compare
- residual plot is still using the lowess curve
- Cook's D plot includes tooltips at the y=0 location
- histogram density interactive issue - try?: style(ggplotly(p), hoverinfo = "skip", traces = 2)
- make smoother tooltips consistent
- change order residuals vs leverage interactive plot does the x,y positions last instead of first

Katherine's Tasks:
- need to update vignette to say that lme models are now allowed
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
- look into the "safely" functions or write your own function for managing the error of...
  - Error in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
  polygon edge not found
- dataset ideas:
  - dasl or ozdasl
  - tise journal
  - https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data
  - ecology journal databases
- I get some warnings about the loess curve with the following code:
  m2 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
  resid_panel(m2, plots = "lev")
  - What do we want to do about this?
- add references to vignette
- swich all plots order
- change title

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer (Katie)
- look into testthat and vistest packages for testing
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- add in minimum package versions?? (under imports)
- add interactive versions of the auxpanel, xpanel, and compare plots
  - maybe add an option in each of the functions for an interactive version
- option to color residuals by predictor variables?
