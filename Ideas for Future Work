Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- DATA!!!!!
- try to figure out why plotly graphs showing up horizontally (still an issue?)
- Work on residual vignette (IN PROGRESS)
  - include a link to the residual document in the documentation
- modify so works for predictive models (Research at least)(NOT FOR CRAN)
  -randomForest (from randomForest): contains 'y' and 'predicted' (class is randomForest.formula)(
  - neuralnet (from neuralnet): contains 'response', 'covariates' and 'data' (class is nn)
  - nnet (from nnet): contains 'residuals' and 'fitted.values' (class is nnet)
  - svm (from e1071): contains 'fitted' and 'residuals' (class is svm)
- test file
  - add lmertest to test functionality on lmer objects
  - add lme examples to tests
  - NOTE:USING THE WORD plot instead of plots
  - NOTE: if plotting a panel of four plots, nrow DOES NOT USE THIRD ROW when nrow = 3
- histogram density interactive issue - try?: style(ggplotly(p), hoverinfo = "skip", traces = 2)
      - style not working for this: did work for cooks d plot

- Completed:
  - fix resid_interact for binomial case to be more general (Double check names with Katherine)
  - residual plot is still using the lowess curve (switched to "loess" using geom_smooth)
  - plot_ls: trying to suppress "pseudoinverse" warning (Katherine figured this out)
  - make smoother tooltips consistent (Do we want observation added for smoother?)
  - Cook's D plot includes tooltips at the y=0 location
  - change order residuals vs leverage interactive plot does the x,y positions last instead of first
  - switch the order of the plots in resid_compare

Katherine's Tasks:

To Do
- fix response residual issue with lev, constant lev, and ls plots
- figure out how to adjust the size issue
- adjust tutorial links in intro vignette and readme once tutorial is posted
- move tutorial to new repo

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- cleaning board game data and coach salary data to use for paper (and vignettes?)
- add in links in vignettes to the residual vignette (when finished)
- contact Jessica Meir to ask for citation of penguin data
- figure out how to use the "safely" and "quietly" functions to only show desired
  warnings and suppress the error:
    grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
      polygon edge not found (Katherine)
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer (Katie)
- look into testthat and vistest packages for testing
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- add in minimum package versions?? (under imports)
- add interactive versions of the auxpanel, xpanel, and compare plots
  - maybe add an option in each of the functions for an interactive version
- option to color residuals by predictor variables?
- add a resid versus y plot
