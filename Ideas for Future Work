Future Work
---------------

Katie's Tasks:
- DATA!!!!!
- try to figure out why plotly graphs showing up horizontally
- Work on residual vignette (IN PROGRESS)
  - include a link to the residual document in the documentation
- modify so works for predictive models (Research at least)(NOT FOR CRAN)
  -receive predictive model in resid_panel
- test file
  - add lmertest to test functionality on lmer objects
  - add lme examples to tests
  - NOTE:USING THE WORD plot instead of plots
  - NOTE: if plotting a panel of four plots, nrow DOES NOT USE THIRD ROW when nrow = 3
- histogram density interactive issue - try?: style(ggplotly(p), hoverinfo = "skip", traces = 2)
      - style not working for this: did work for cooks d plot

- Completed:
  - fix resid_interact for binomial case to be more general (Double check names with Katherine)
  - residual plot is still using the lowess curve (switched to "loess" using geom_smooth)
  - plot_ls: trying to suppress "pseudoinverse" warning (Katherine figured this out)
  - make smoother tooltips consistent (Do we want observation added for smoother?)
  - Cook's D plot includes tooltips at the y=0 location
  - change order residuals vs leverage interactive plot does the x,y positions last instead of first
  - switch the order of the plots in resid_compare

Katherine's Tasks:

To Do
- move all tests to test-that
- add tests to check warnings
- find more data
  - dasl
  - https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday
  - https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/everything#data-and-analyses
- adjust all of the documentation examples to use package data
- make an introduction vignette
  - include penguin data
- add in sentence and link in the tutorial vignette to the residual vignette (when finished)

Completed
- added smoother options to lev and ls plots
- change title to include usermanual and add a subtitle
- need to update vignette to say that lme models are now allowed
- check all of the hyperlinks
- added penguin data to package
- add references to vignette (formula for Cook's D & value of 1 for Cook's D)
- added LICENSE file
- figure out how to handle tutorial vignette with CRAN (or not) and add cache back
- work on getting CRAN checks all passed
- finish reading about vdiffr: https://github.com/r-lib/vdiffr

Ask Katie
- What reference did you use for:
  - 4/n for Cook's D plot? (I found one that would work?)
  - density curve on the histogram?
- Do you think the trees data in the tutorial is okay?
- I'm thinking of not including the tutorial vignette in the package?
- Can we change the constant leverage plot title? (too long)

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- figure out how to use the "safely" and "quietly" functions to only show desired
  warnings and suppress the error:
    grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
      polygon edge not found (Katherine)
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer (Katie)
- look into testthat and vistest packages for testing
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- add in minimum package versions?? (under imports)
- add interactive versions of the auxpanel, xpanel, and compare plots
  - maybe add an option in each of the functions for an interactive version
- option to color residuals by predictor variables?
