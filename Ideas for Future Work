Katie's Tasks:
- change all functions to accept different residual types
  -Update to use resid_resid
-Add in error to moderate residual types
- update resid_interact to show relevant info
  - make the individual interactive plots first
  - can show response, all predictors, row number, only first five predictors
- Take out default values in individual functions
- look into standardized residuals used in ls and lev for glm
- Add in error so lmer and glmer can't use All, R, lev, los, and cook's d
-at resid to vinette
-error to check if model contains X matrix

Katherine's Tasks:
- Two factor leverage plot
- add additional two plots to SASextend
- figure out error with text table that sometimes appears:
  Error in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
  polygon edge not found


Other To Do Before Conference:
- move all documentation to resid_panel or supplemental document
- improve examples in help file for resid_panel
- figure out how to get standardized lmer and glmer residuals
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each of residual type
- get new version up and running
- design and print stickers

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer
- add option to plot standardized residuals for lmer and glmer
- put interactive plots in a grid
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- write a function for showing plots from multiple transformations (the user can specify
  the transformations)
