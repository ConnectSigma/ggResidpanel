Katie's Tasks:
- suppress geom_path warning
- update histogram tooltip

Katherine's Tasks:

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- maybe add some sort of random forest or other method to examples in resid_auxpanel
- remove interactivity for density curve in resid_hist
- remove periods after non-sentances in documentation
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each residual type
- constant leverage factor plot
- try to add data to interactive qq plot
- create a development rmd file with updates for each version
- add alpha values to lev plot
- Include a link to the residual document in the documentation
- figure out how to get desired order of plots when individual plots are requested
- include a SASextended option
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer
- put interactive plots in a grid
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- modify so works for predictive models
- create a panel of residual plots verses the X's
- add interactive plot to readme

Mystery Errors/Warnings:

geom_path: Each group consists of only one observation. Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic?
Warning messages:
1: In sqrt(0.5 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
2: In sqrt(0.5 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
3: In sqrt(1 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
4: In sqrt(1 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
