Katie's Tasks:
- update resid_interact to show relevant info

Katherine's Tasks:
- clean up resid_interact
- clean up "s" plot options and change name to "aux"
- clean up resid_glm_actual and resid_plotly_label
- move all documentation to resid_panel or supplemental document
- improve examples in the help files
- determine what to do about plotly error
- add two factor leverage plot
- adjust title for standardized deviance residuals vs ... gets cut off in R
Completed:
- changed title to title.opt
- cleaned up resid_panel and all static plots
Notes:
- Which plots should only be used with "lm" models? (We need to update this
  in the "all" part of the resid_panel function.)
- Do we need standardized Pearson residuals for "lm"
- How to get density and count to be captialized in the histogram?
  - same with theoretical and sample in the qq plot

Other To Do Before Conference:
- get new version up and running
- design and print stickers
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each of residual type

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- include a SASextended option
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer
- put interactive plots in a grid
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- modify so works for predictive models
