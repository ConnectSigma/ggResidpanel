Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- DATA!!!!!
- try to figure out why plotly graphs showing up horizontally
- Work on residual vignette (IN PROGRESS)
  - include a link to the residual document in the documentation
- constant leverage factor plot
   - add to test file and add lmertest to test functionality on lmer objects
- modify so works for predictive models (Research at least)(NOT FOR CRAN)
  -receive predictive model in resid_panel
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time (In Progress)
  - resid_compare
- add lme examples to tests
- switch the order of the plots in resid_compare
- Cook's D plot includes tooltips at the y=0 location
- histogram density interactive issue - try?: style(ggplotly(p), hoverinfo = "skip", traces = 2)
- make smoother tooltips consistent
- change order residuals vs leverage interactive plot does the x,y positions last instead of first

- Completed:
  - fix resid_interact for binomial case to be more general (Double check names with Katherine)
  - residual plot is still using the lowess curve (switched to "loess" using geom_smooth)
  - plot_ls: trying to suppress "pseudoinverse" warning (Katherine figured this out)


Katherine's Tasks:
- code:
  - look into the "safely" functions or write your own function for managing error:
    - Error in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
    polygon edge not found
- vignette:
  - change title to include usermanual and add a subtitle
  - need to update vignette to say that lme models are now allowed
  - make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - dataset ideas:
    - dasl or ozdasl
    - tise journal
    - https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data
    - ecology journal databases
  - add references to vignette

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer (Katie)
- look into testthat and vistest packages for testing
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- add in minimum package versions?? (under imports)
- add interactive versions of the auxpanel, xpanel, and compare plots
  - maybe add an option in each of the functions for an interactive version
- option to color residuals by predictor variables?
