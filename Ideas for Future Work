Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- update resid_interact to show relevant info

Katherine's Tasks:
- updated documentation for resid_panel, resid_interact, and resid_auxpanel
- improve examples in the help files
- clean up helper_glm_actual and helper_plotly_label
- email Heike about plotly error
- add two factor leverage plot
- Completed:
  - changed title to title.opt
  - cleaned up resid_panel and all static plots
  - clean up "s" plot options and change name to "aux"
  - clean up resid_interact
  - change helper function names
  - moved all documentation to exported functions
- Notes:
  - Which plots should only be used with "lm" models? (We need to update this
    in the "all" part of the resid_panel function.)
  - Do we need standardized Pearson residuals for "lm"
  - How to get density and count to be captialized in the histogram?
    - same with theoretical and sample in the qq plot
  - Titles are getting cut off with longer names -- could we make shorter titles
    that don't include the type of residual -- just have the axis with the type?

Other To Do Before Conference:
- get new version up and running
- create a development rmd file with updates for each version
- design and print stickers
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each of residual type

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- include a SASextended option
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer
- put interactive plots in a grid
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- modify so works for predictive models
