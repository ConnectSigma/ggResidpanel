Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- DATA!!!!!
- try to figure out why plotly graphs showing up horizontally
- Work on residual vignette (IN PROGRESS)
  - include a link to the residual document in the documentation
- modify so works for predictive models (Research at least)(NOT FOR CRAN)
  -receive predictive model in resid_panel
- test file
  - add lmertest to test functionality on lmer objects
  - add lme examples to tests
  - NOTE:USING THE WORD plot instead of plots
  - NOTE: if plotting a panel of four plots, nrow DOES NOT USE THIRD ROW when nrow = 3
- histogram density interactive issue - try?: style(ggplotly(p), hoverinfo = "skip", traces = 2)
      - style not working for this: did work for cooks d plot

- Completed:
  - fix resid_interact for binomial case to be more general (Double check names with Katherine)
  - residual plot is still using the lowess curve (switched to "loess" using geom_smooth)
  - plot_ls: trying to suppress "pseudoinverse" warning (Katherine figured this out)
  - make smoother tooltips consistent (Do we want observation added for smoother?)
  - Cook's D plot includes tooltips at the y=0 location
  - change order residuals vs leverage interactive plot does the x,y positions last instead of first
  - switch the order of the plots in resid_compare

Katherine's Tasks:

To Do
- finish introduction vignette

Completed
- Added penguin data to package
- Adjusted all of the documentation examples to use package data
- Added smoother options to lev and ls plots
- Change vignette title to include usermanual and add a subtitle
- Updated vignette to say that lme models are now allowed
- Checked all of the hyperlinks
- Added references to vignette (formula for Cook's D & value of 1 for Cook's D)
- Added LICENSE file
- Worked on getting CRAN checks all passed
- Finished reading about vdiffr: https://github.com/r-lib/vdiffr
- Started working with vdiffr for tests
- Put residual vignette in build-ignore for now
- Fixed this warning: test-resid_panel.R:124: warning: glm poisson
  the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used

Ask Katie
- What reference did you use for:
  - 4/n for Cook's D plot? (I found one that would work?)
  - density curve on the histogram?
- Do you think the trees data in the tutorial and the README is okay?
- I'm thinking of not including the tutorial vignette in the package?
- Can we change the constant leverage plot title? (too long)
- Do you want to finish the process of moving the tests to vdiffr?
- Can you add the code for creating the sticker to the data-raw folder in the package?
- What do we want to do about the tutorial? (Should I change the format or just post it on my webpage?)
- Should we add tests to check warnings?
- Issues with rounding in the interactive penguin plots?
- What do we want to do about this?
  - constant leverage plot breaks when there is a glm model with type = "response"
    since no option for creating the Std_Res
      glm_poisson_model <- glm(count ~ spray, family = "poisson", data = InsectSprays)
      resid_panel(glm_model, plots = "lev", type = "response")
  - lev plot also breaking when glm model with type = "response"
    since no option for creating the Std_Res
      library(lme4)
      glm_binomial_model <- glm(cbind(incidence, size - incidence) ~ period,
      data = cbpp, family = binomial)
      resid_panel(glm_binomial_model, plots = "lev", type = "response")
  - ls plot is also breaking with glm models with type = "response" because again
    there is no option for creating the Std_Res

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- cleaning board game data and coach salary data to use for paper (and vignettes?)
- add in links in vignettes to the residual vignette (when finished)
- contact Jessica Meir to ask for citation of penguin data
- figure out how to use the "safely" and "quietly" functions to only show desired
  warnings and suppress the error:
    grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
      polygon edge not found (Katherine)
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer (Katie)
- look into testthat and vistest packages for testing
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- add in minimum package versions?? (under imports)
- add interactive versions of the auxpanel, xpanel, and compare plots
  - maybe add an option in each of the functions for an interactive version
- option to color residuals by predictor variables?
