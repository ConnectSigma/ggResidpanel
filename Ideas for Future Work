Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- DATA!!!!!
- try to figure out why plotly graphs showing up horizontally
- Work on residual vignette
  - include a link to the residual document in the documentation
- constant leverage factor plot
  - use isConst.hat from getanywhere(plot.lm)
  - Perform more error checking with more than categorical variable
  - add to test file and add lmertest to test functionality on lmer objects
- modify so works for predictive models (Research at least)(NOT FOR CRAN)
  -receive predictive model in resid_panel
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time (In Progress)
  - resid_compare
- fix resid_interact for binomial case to be more general

Katherine's Tasks:
- find dataset
- updated readme including an interactive plot (see plotly readme)
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each residual type
  - example for interpreting
- create a development rmd file with updates for each version

- completed:
  - add alpha values to lev plot
  - create limits outside of the plot and subset the contour lines to within the limits
    of the leverage plot
  - updated documentation for leverage plot
  - update default in auxpanel
- questions:
  - I get some warnings about the loess curve with the following code:
  - m2 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
  - resid_panel(m2, plots = "lev")
  - What do we want to do about this?

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer (Katie)
- look into testthat and vistest packages for testing
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- improve the R plots — don’t just copy what the default in R gives — make it better
- add in minimum package versions?? (under imports)
- add interactive versions of the auxpanel, xpanel, and compare plots
  - maybe add an option in each of the functions for an interactive version

Mystery Errors/Warnings:

Error in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
  polygon edge not found
