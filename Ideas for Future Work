Future Work
--------------

Katie's Tasks:
- update histogram tooltip
  -shows count as count and density as count: try to change name of density to density
- try to figure out why plotly graphs showing up horizontally
- Work on residual vignette
- constant leverage factor plot
  - Perform more error checking with more than categorical variable
  - add to test file and add lmertest to test functionality on lmer objects
- modify so works for predictive models (Research at least)(NOT FOR CRAN)
  -receive predictive model in resid_panel
- remove obs from data for interactive plots for the index plot
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
  - not a function in ggresidpanel yet
  - resid_compare
- change smoother to loess in ls plot

Katherine's Tasks:
- finish removing bin warnings
- change names of functions
- figure out issue with scale with grid.arrange (or figure out how to use plot_grid instead)
- fix the smoother option for factor variables (and change smoother method ?)
   - check on this and get rid of warnings?
- update documentation
  - I've noticed some typos
  - update for changes
  - remove periods after non-sentences in documentation
  - add documentation for predictor panel
- add interactive plot to readme (see plotly readme)
- create a development rmd file with updates for each version
- add alpha values to lev plot
  - figure out what alpha is
  - add example of interpreting
- change back to only nrow option

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- improve the R plots — don’t just copy what the default in R gives — make it better
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each residual type
  - maybe look for great lakes data
- look into testthat and vistest packages for testing
  - could put the testthat folder in gitignore
- include a link to the residual document in the documentation
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer (Katie)
- could look into more helpful diagnostic plots that exist
- add in minimum package versions?? (under imports)
- add an option for including additional predictor variables

Mystery Errors/Warnings:

geom_path: Each group consists of only one observation. Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic?
Warning messages:
1: In sqrt(0.5 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
2: In sqrt(0.5 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
3: In sqrt(1 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
4: In sqrt(1 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced

Error in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
