Katie's Tasks:
- histogram fix so no outliers cutoff
- add label function to all plots
- work on residual type options
- change qq plot to the version created by Adam and Heike with an option to have a confidence band (qqplotr)
- create resid_interact
- work on editing error messages - move to resid_panel function

Katherine's Tasks:
- add additional two plots to SASextend
- Completed:
  - add smoother to residual plot for R panel
  - residual vs. leverage plot - clean up code
  - create response versus predicted
  - summary statistc/model fit values panel
  - fix problem with SASextend

To Do Before Conference:
- change all functions to accept different residual types
- add a standardized residual plot to the SASextend option
- change qq plot to the version created by Adam and Heike with an option to have a confidence band (qqplotr)
- add options for theme
- add options for text size
- create error using class to specify only four model types
- make the individual interactive plots first
  - can show response, all predictors, row number, only first five predictors
- figure out how to get standardized lmer and glmer residuals
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each of residual type
- get new version up and running
- design and print stickers

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- put interactive plots in a grid
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- write a function for showing plots from multiple transformations (the user can specify
  the transformations)
