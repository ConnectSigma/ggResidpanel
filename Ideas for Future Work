Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- update resid_interact to show relevant info
- with sligth additions, we could modify so works for predictive models
Farther future:
- figure out how to get standardized lmer and glmer residuals

Completed:
- change all functions to accept different residual types
- Add in error to moderate residual types
- Take out default values in individual functions
- Add in error so lmer and glmer can't use All, R, lev, los, and cook's d

Katherine's Tasks:
- Move all documentation to resid_panel or supplemental document
- Improve examples in help file for resid_panel
- Two factor leverage plot
- Email Heike about plotly error
- add title.opt to plotly
Notes:
- Title for standardized deviance residuals vs ... gets cut off in R
- I realized that I made a mistake with the stats -- will need to write a
  much more detailed function that extracts the correct information from
  each model
- I'm wondering if we should not include the SASextend option in this
  version of the model (unless I get time to finish this next week)
- convert prediction to ilink scale in respred: I think it is already on
  the ilink scale -- is there something that I missed?
- Maybe change the name of type to residtype
- Which plots should only be used with "lm" models? (We need to update this
  in the "all" part of the resid_panel function.)
- Do we need standardized Pearson residuals for "lm"
Completed:
- changed title to title.opt


Other To Do Before Conference:
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each of residual type
- get new version up and running
- design and print stickers
- figure out how to handle the plotly warning

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- include a SASextended option
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer
- add option to plot standardized residuals for lmer and glmer
- put interactive plots in a grid
- write a function for showing plots from multiple transformations (the user can specify the transformations)
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
