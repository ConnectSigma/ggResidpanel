Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- update histogram tooltip (DONE)
    -shows count as count and density as count: try to change name of density to density
    - fixed by requested 'density' and 'fill' in the tooltip
- try to figure out why plotly graphs showing up horizontally
- Work on residual vignette
  - include a link to the residual document in the documentation
- constant leverage factor plot
  - Perform more error checking with more than categorical variable
  - add to test file and add lmertest to test functionality on lmer objects
- modify so works for predictive models (Research at least)(NOT FOR CRAN)
  -receive predictive model in resid_panel
- remove obs from data for interactive plots for the index plot
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
  - not a function in ggresidpanel yet
  - resid_compare
- change smoother to loess in ls plot

Katherine's Tasks:
- fix resid_xpanel with the response is binary
- add an interactive plot example to readme (see plotly readme)
- add alpha values to lev plot
  - figure out what alpha is
  - add example of interpreting
- create a development rmd file with updates for each version
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each residual type
- completed:
  - question for Katie: smoother looks weird with the constant leverage plot
  - switched all panels to use plot_grid from cowplot (this fixed the scale issue since
    grid.arrange does not have a scale option)
  - add warnings to resid_xpanel
  - get rid of smoother warnings with resid_xpanel (specified method in geom_smooth)
  - update documentation
    - I've noticed some typos
    - update for changes
    - add documentation for predictor panel

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer (Katie)
- look into testthat and vistest packages for testing
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- improve the R plots — don’t just copy what the default in R gives — make it better
- add in minimum package versions?? (under imports)
- add interactive versions of the auxpanel, xpanel, and compare plots
  - maybe add an option in each of the functions for an interactive version

Mystery Errors/Warnings:

geom_path: Each group consists of only one observation. Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic?
Warning messages:
1: In sqrt(0.5 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
2: In sqrt(0.5 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
3: In sqrt(1 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
4: In sqrt(1 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
