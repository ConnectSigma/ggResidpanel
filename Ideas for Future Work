Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- suppress geom_path warning
- update histogram tooltip
- Could possibly use the function “suppress_messages” to not have the plotly error showing
- try to figure out why plotly graphs showing up horizontal
- remove interactivity for density curve in resid_hist
- try to add data to interactive qq plot

Katherine's Tasks:
- figure out how to appropriately load packages

Ideas for Future Package Versions:
- maybe add some sort of random forest or other method to examples in resid_auxpanel
- remove periods after non-sentences in documentation
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each residual type
- constant leverage factor plot
- create a development rmd file with updates for each version
- add alpha values to lev plot
- Include a link to the residual document in the documentation
- figure out how to get desired order of plots when individual plots are requested
- include a SASextended option
- write a function for computing standardized residuals for lmer and glmer
- put interactive plots in a grid
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- create an option for the user to add their own theme
- modify so works for predictive models
- create a panel of residual plots verses the X's
- add interactive plot to readme
- look into broom package
- create a md file with updates to the package
- look into testthat and vistest packages for testing (then could put the testthat folder in
  gitignore)
- find a dataset to use
- Include a resid vs. index plot (he likes to look at this plot often)
- Change the default to our four diagnostic plots that we think are the most useful and leave the   SAS option as one of the available options to choose from (since the boxplot is really not that   helpful)
- Improve the R plots — don’t just copy what the default in R gives — make it better
- Suggested not changing the version to 1.0.0 until the package is ready for CRAN (or wide usage)
- Could look into more helpful diagnostic plots that exist
- add in an option for lmerTest model

Presentations:
- ISU graphics group fall 2018 (request to present)
- LunchinatoRs fall 2018 (request to present)
- Agricultural Meeting in Baltimore (look into)

Mystery Errors/Warnings:

geom_path: Each group consists of only one observation. Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic?
Warning messages:
1: In sqrt(0.5 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
2: In sqrt(0.5 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
3: In sqrt(1 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced
4: In sqrt(1 * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced

Error in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
