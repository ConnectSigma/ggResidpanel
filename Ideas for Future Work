Future Work

Katie's Tasks:
- scale-location plot - quick updates
- Cook's D - quick updates - add error
- histogram fix so no outliers cutoff
- create label function
- check on default

Katherine's Tasks:
- residual vs. leverage plot - see if I can figure out Cook's D contours
- need to make plot selection option better
- there seem to be problems with lmer and glmer -- figure out what is wrong
- Work Done :
  - changed text size in residual vs. leverage plot
  - changed to model input: resid_plot, resid_boxplot, resid_hist, resid_qq,
                        resid_panel
  - updated help files: resid_plot, residlev_plot, resid_boxplot, resid_hist,
                        resid_qq, resid_panel
  - added comments and "standardized"" code for plots: resid_plot, residlev_plot,
                        resid_boxplot, resid_hist, resid_qq, resid_panel
  - add in error for the update
  - work on option for selecting plots in grid


Order of Tasks:
1. Change all functions to accept models and different residual types
2. Change all functions to include label options - create a function for this
3. Check on default residuals for the model types
4. Make additional plot options
5. Option for choosing types of residuals
6. Make plots interactive

Ideas for future updates:
- be able to choose SAS versus R default residual panel
- be able to choose specific plots to show in the panel
- plots to add:
    - standardized residual plot
    - add a smoother to the residual plot
    - leverage plot (version from R)
    - Cook's D plot from SAS
    - influence plots
    - response versus predicted (with a fitted line)
    - ??? summary statistc/model fit values panel
    - make our own version of influential points plot
- add options for theme, text size, axis labels, etc...
- incorporate plotly, so you can identify outliers more easily (could include this as an
  option, so the user can decide whether they want their plots to be interactive or not)
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- write a function for showing plots from multiple transformations (the user can specify
  the transformations)
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each of residual type
