Katie's Tasks:
- histogram fix so no outliers cutoff
        --currently not having the same problem: I think I fixed it, but will run it          through more tests
- add label function to all plots
- work on residual type options
- change qq plot to the version created by Adam and Heike with an option to have a confidence band (qqplotr)
- create resid_interact
- work on editing error messages - move to resid_panel function

Katherine's Tasks:
- residual vs. leverage plot - clean up code
- add smoother to residual plot for R panel
- create response versus predicted
- summary statistc/model fit values panel

To Do Before Conference:
1. Change all functions to accept different residual types
2. Make additional plot options
3. Option for choosing types of residuals
4. Make plots interactive
5. get new version up and running
6. Design and print stickers

Ideas for future updates:
- be able to choose SAS versus R default residual panel
- be able to choose specific plots to show in the panel
- plots to add:
    - standardized residual plot
    - add a smoother to the residual plot
    - response versus predicted (with a fitted line)
    - summary statistc/model fit values panel
- change qq plot to the version created by Adam and Heike with an option to have a confidence band (qqplotr)
- add options for theme, text size, etc...
- create error using class to specify only four model types
- make the individual interactive plots first
  - can show response, all predictors, row number, only first five predictors
- add in theme options
- figure out how to get standardized lmer and glmer residuals
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- write a function for showing plots from multiple transformations (the user can specify
  the transformations)
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
  - examples for each of residual type
