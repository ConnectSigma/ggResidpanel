## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* I removed some of the examples (from resid_interact) that took a long time to run.
* I removed the words from the description that were being tagged as possibly mis-spelled.

## Test environments
* local OS X (x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit)), R 3.6.0
* Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran (R-hub)
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE (from Fedora Linux and win-builder):

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Katherine Goode <kgoode@iastate.edu>'

I have read that this is an okay note.
