Notes

Ideas for improvement:
- change names of functions for individuals plots to all start with resid_
- add an option for changing the binwidth of histogram
- go through and make sure all functions have the same formatting
- incorporate plotly, so you can identify outliers more easily (could include this as an option,
  so the user can decide whether they want their plots to be interactive or not)
