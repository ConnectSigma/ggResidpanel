Notes

Ideas for future updates:
- adjust the function to be able to take in either a model or residuals and fitted values
- be able to choose SAS versus R default residual panel
- be able to choose specific plots to show in the panel
- plots to add:
    - standardized residual plot
    - add a smoother to the residual plot
    - leverage plot (version from R)
    - Cook's D plot from SAS
    - influence plots
    - response versus predicted (with a fitted line)
    - ??? summary statistc/model fit values panel
- edit examples to make for R correct

Other ideas:
- go through and make sure all functions have the same formatting
- incorporate plotly, so you can identify outliers more easily (could include this as an option,
  so the user can decide whether they want their plots to be interactive or not)
- write a function to show residual plots from multiple models at the same time
- write a function for showing plots from multiple transformations (the user can specify the transformations)
- make a vignette with examples showing how to use the package
