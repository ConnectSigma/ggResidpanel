Notes

Ideas for improvement:
- go through and make sure all functions have the same formatting
- incorporate plotly, so you can identify outliers more easily (could include this as an option,
  so the user can decide whether they want their plots to be interactive or not)
- include some other plot options for the residual panel such as a Cook's distance plot (then
  there could be a defualt four plots and the user could choose between having more or less
  plots and choose the plots they want)
